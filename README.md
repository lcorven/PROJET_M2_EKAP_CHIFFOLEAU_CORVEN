Comme convenu en cour avec vous, ce projet n'est pas encore tout à fait aboutie


 Description : 

A picture is worth a thousand words, yet sometimes a few will do. We all rely on online images for knowledge sharing, learning, and understanding. Even the largest websites are missing visual content and metadata to pair with their images. Captions and “alt text” increase accessibility and enable better search. The majority of images on Wikipedia articles, for example, don't have any written context connected to the image. Open models could help anyone improve accessibility and learning for all.

Current solutions rely on simple methods based on translations or page interlinks, which have limited coverage. Even the most advanced computer vision image captioning isn't suitable for images with complex semantics.
